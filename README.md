# About
I am a BEng Computer Engineering student at the University of Pretoria. I love developing embedded systems that solve complex problems! My main fields of interest are embedded software, sensors and control systems.

## Microcontrollers 

### PIC18
I used the PIC18F45K22 as the brains of an autonomous line-following robot car. The sensor system was built from first principles using photodiodes and the code was written in assembly. We worked in a group of three for four months to complete the project, which was for our first course on microcontrollers.

I am busy working on an autonomous maze-navigating robot for a module on computer engineering design using this microcontroller as well. But am coding in C99 (Embedded C).
