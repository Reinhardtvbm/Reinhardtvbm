# About
I am a BEng Computer Engineering student at the University of Pretoria. I love developing embedded systems that solve complex problems! My main fields of interest are embedded software, sensors and control systems.

## Microcontrollers 

### PIC18
I used the PIC18F45K22 as the brains of an autonomous line-following robot car. The sensor system was built from first principles using photodiodes and the code was written in assembly. We worked in a group of three for four months to complete the project, which was for our first course on microcontrollers.

### Arduino nano
I am worked in a team of three undergraduate engineers to develop an autonomous maze navigating robot, for which I was responsible for the state and navigation control subsystem (SNC). This was completed for our course in system's engineering. Developing the robot was done by following a system's engineering process (needs analysis, concept exploration, concept definition, engineering development, and integration). A complete system was created by integrating the SNC with a motor and power supply subsystem (MDPS), and sensor subsystem (SS), via serial communication using the Arduino Nano's onboard USART.
